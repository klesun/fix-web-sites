Fix the web sites!
==================

We all know and love such sites as google, rutracker, myanimelist, wikipedia, etc...

But truth be told, these sites are written by alive humans, and what do we know about alive humans? Exactly - they happen to mistake. 

It's our job as consumers to forgive them and correct their mistakes when we can do what they can't.

Scripts in /cjs/ directory are intended to be put to [cjs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija?hl=en) or similar plugin for each site to remove ads that are too smart for adblock or to do stuff that improves your user experience.

You can put the links to these scripts instead of copying the code to keep up-to-date using [rawgit](https://rawgit.com/). 
But make sure not to do it this way with your bank account sites =3. Put code only manually there and read it very carefully!
